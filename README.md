the client and server codes work by sending python server.py and then sending the port number to listen on. 
large code blocks were avoided and replaced by small understandable functions to be implemented.
we worked on the project by opening terminals on a mac computer, one for client and one for each user. 
python server.py ("then port number") and python client.py for each client. a suitable connection will be shown one a new client open it
in the codes presented the port we were listening on was 6421, as mentioned as port number in server code and passed as argument after server.py during running. 
the code imports sqlite3, json, os, pretty table, bcrypt and base64
